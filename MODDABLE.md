# Moddable Games

This document maintains a list of Dojo games with modding guides for game jams.
If you're looking to get your feet wet by modding an existing Dojo game, these are great places to start!

## Dope Wars

One of the earliest and most iconic Dojo games, an on-chain version of the 1980's classic Drug Wars.

See the [development guide](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/dopewars/blob/main/README.md) for instructions on how to set up your development environment, and the [game jam guide](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/dopewars/blob/main/GAMEJAM.md) for ideas on how to mod or extend the game.
